    "During my time at university, where I pursued finance, I developed an interest in website design and coding. Before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia, I enjoyed traveling, camping under the open sky, and playing in musical bands. I also organized concerts, football tournaments, film screenings, and workshops. For over 7 years, I worked as a director for live broadcasts and recordings on various television channels.",

    "From April 2022, I have been actively studying JavaScript. Prior to that, I was involved in developing simple websites such as business card site and landing pages with post requests to PHP. I also maintained a couple of websites on Joomla and WordPress. Now, after a 6-year break, I am determined to dive back into web development."]
